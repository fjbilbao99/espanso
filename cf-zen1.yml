      Hi there,
      
      Thank you for contacting Cloudflare Support. My name is Xabier and I will be taking a look at this ticket for you. Sorry to hear that you experienced an attack against your website.
      
      I put together a comparison from last weeks "normal" traffic (right-hand side) with today's attack traffic you experienced (left-hand side).
      
      ![](xxximgxxx)
      
      We do recommend whitelisting only Cloudflare IPs and block all others at your origin server. You can find a list of all IPs here - https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/.

      Here are the logs of what we are seeing on our end.

      **Top ASN**

      ```
      ASN     max     avg     total


      ```
      
      **Top Countries**
      
      ```
      Countries   max     avg     total
      
      
      ```
      
      **Top Requests**
      
      ```
      Requests    max     avg     total
      
      
      ```
      
      **Top Agents**
      
      ```
      Agents  max     avg     total
      
      ```
      
      You can use this information to help mitigate the attack. You can use the [IP Access Rules](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/217074967-How-do-I-control-IP-access-to-my-site-), block/challenge - IP address/ranges, and Countries.
      
      You can block/challenge the top [User Agents](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001856951-How-do-I-block-malicious-User-Agents-with-Cloudflare-) by using User Agent Blocking.
      
      Finally [Firewall Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/cf-firewall-rules/fields-and-expressions/) is a new feature that is very helpful to string multiple rules into one.
      
      See [Best Practices: DDoS preventative measures](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170166-Best-Practices-DDoS-preventative-measures?source=search)
      
      Please let us know if you have any further questions or issues by replying to this e-mail or ticket.
